              The Nano network is a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency
              platform designed for instant and feeless transactions. Unlike
              traditional blockchain systems like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which
              rely on Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) and use mining
              to validate transactions, Nano employs a unique mechanism called
              the &quot;block lattice&quot; and the &quot;Open Representative
              Voting&quot; (ORV) consensus protocol.
